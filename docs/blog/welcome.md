# New website

We've finally launched a decent site with documentation and guides.
Up until now, it has been very difficult to learn Imba, even if you
were really interested. We still have a long road ahead, but at least
we have docs, guides, and examples to lead the way.

## Scrimbla

Every snippet on the site is editable, and runnable, thanks to a brand 
new web-based code editor written in Imba. It still has *many* quirks
and issues, but it already has some cool features, like live error 
reporting, both from the compiler and from running (with sourcemapping).
